<b>Object Oriented Programming 2</b>

Final Term Lab Assignment 

Create a Digital Photo Diary where user can store/create an event with date specified.
Picture(s) can be added to any specific event. Each picture can contain a story. A person
can create multiple events. Home window should display the list of events that a user has
created. A person can view the details (pictures and stories) of any event that he/she has
created. A person can modify (change the picture/story) the existing events and can
delete any specific event from his/her diary. Last Modification date is also recorded in the
system. One unique feature of the system is a user can set the importance (high, moderate,
less important) of any event. Each person can be uniquely identified by the system. After a
successful login, his/her diary of events are displayed on home screen.
